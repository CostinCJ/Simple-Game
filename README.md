# Simple-Game
This Unity game is a learning project I made using tutorial assets created for beginners. It has multiple scenes, each teaching me something new about game development:  

- **Main Menu Scene**: A simple menu where I can see my name and all the scenes I can select.  
- **Playground Scene**: This was my first time working in Unity's 3D space. Here, I learned how to move objects and navigate the 3D environment, which was an important step in understanding how the engine works.  
- **Kid's Room Scene**: In this scene, I decorated a kid’s room with furniture and added a ball, a ramp, and some cubes. I made the ball roll down the ramp and knock over the cubes, which taught me how to create environments and use rigidbodies to simulate physics.  
- **Kitchen Scene**: This scene helped me learn about using sounds in a game. I added boiling sounds to a pot, background music, and bird noises that play when you go near the window.  
- **3D Mini-Game Scene**: This is a small game where a cleaning robot collects dirt cubes. When the robot bumps into a cube, it disappears, and particles appear to show it’s been collected. This taught me about interactivity and adding visual feedback.  
- **2D Game Scene**: A simple 2D game where a car collects stars in a colorful environment. I also added an animated cat to make it more fun and learned how to design 2D environments and animations.

This project was a great learning experience for me because I got to practice while creating something fun. It helped me take my first steps toward understanding Unity and game development!
